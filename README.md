## Movie Game Logic

1. The first movie is randomly generated.  
   **(If a player later enters the same movie as the starter, they must enter a different one.)**

2. Each player selects a **movie genre** from the database as their **long-term win condition**.  
   Both players may choose the same genre.

3. In each round, the movie a player names must be **connected to the opponentâ€™s previous movie**.  
   - **Valid connections include:** shared actor, director, writer, cinematographer, or composer.  
   - The movie **does not need to match the playerâ€™s selected genre** in every round.

4. Input rules:
   - **If an invalid movie name (e.g., incorrect title or previously used movie) is entered, prompt the player to re-enter.**
   - **If no movie is entered within the time limit â†’ automatic loss.**
   - **If a valid movie is entered, check if the same type of connection has already been used more than 3 times:**
     - **If so â†’ automatic loss.**

5. A player wins by either:  
   - **Being the first to name 5 movies that match their selected genre**,  
   â€” or â€”  
   - **If the opponent fails to name a connected movie within 30 seconds.**

> ðŸ“Œ **Notes:**  
> - **Each movie can only be used once.** Repeated entries are not allowed.  
> - **Each connection type (e.g., actor) can be used a maximum of 3 times.**
